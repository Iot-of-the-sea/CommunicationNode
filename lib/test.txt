At least once a year I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili.
The trick is to undercook the onions. Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot.
I'm serious about this stuff. I'm up the night before, pressing garlic, and dicing whole tomatoes.
I toast my own ancho chiles. 

It's a recipe passed down from Malones for generations - it's probably the thing I do best.
